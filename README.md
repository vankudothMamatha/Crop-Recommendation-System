Agricultural productivity largely depends on selecting crops that are suitable for specific soil and environmental conditions. Traditional crop selection methods often rely on farmers’ experience, which may lead to suboptimal decisions due to changing climate patterns and limited access to agronomic knowledge. This study presents a Crop Recommendation System based on Machine Learning, utilizing the Random Forest algorithm to accurately predict the most suitable crop for cultivation. The system analyzes key soil parameters (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, pH) and environmental factors (temperature, humidity, and rainfall) to identify complex patterns and relationships within historical agricultural datasets. Random Forest is chosen for its robustness, ability to handle non-linear data, and strong performance with multiclass classification problems. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves high accuracy and reliable generalization, making it effective for real-world agricultural decision-making. The system aims to support farmers by providing data-driven crop recommendations, thereby enhancing productivity, improving resource utilization, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.
